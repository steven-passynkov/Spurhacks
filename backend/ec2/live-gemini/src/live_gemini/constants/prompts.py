AGENT_ROUTER_PROMPT = """
The user asked: "{query}".

Previous Conversation: 
{conversation_history}

Available Agents:
{agents_info}

Instructions:
1. Review all available agents above, including their descriptions, capabilities, and sample user questions.
2. For every user query, always call two tools in order:
   a. retrieve_products (with a carefully constructed 'query' and an appropriate 'k' value based on the user's query and context)
   b. agent_selector (with the user's query and the list of agents)
3. Analyze the user's query and conversation history to determine the most relevant search query and the optimal number of results ('k') to retrieve for the retrieve_products tool.
   - If the user specifies a number of products, use that as 'k'. Otherwise, choose a reasonable default (e.g., 4).
   - Summarize the user's main intent for the 'query' parameter.
4. Use this conversation history for context: {conversation_history}
5. Execute both tool calls and return their results.

!Important: Do not respond to the user directly. Only return the results of the tool calls.
